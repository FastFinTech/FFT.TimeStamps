# Other utilities

- [`Ticks`](xref:FFT.TimeStamps.Ticks) provides extension methods for time expressed as `long ticks`.
- [`DateTimes`](xref:FFT.TimeStamps.DateTimes) provides extension methods for time expressed as `DateTine time`.

Most of the operations performed on `TimeStamps` and other higher-level objects re-use the methods found in the `Ticks` class as it allows you to operate on the simplest expression of time.

There are extension methods found in both classes that provide functionality not found elsewhere in the library as well. See the api specification for each class to find them.
